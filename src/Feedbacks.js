                <br />Insight, Collaboration, Dedication, Integrity, and Candor are just some of the attributes I experienced daily while working with Saswat Behera for over 3 years. Although he did not report to me directly, he approached each interaction with myself, and more importantly our Operations team, with the highest level of respect and professionalism affording us a truly open dialogue which resulted in tremendous improvements to our product.

                Delivering a dynamic Point of Sale application required assistance from Saswat and his team in India to support our team in the US. Regardless of the time of day, he coordinated the support needed to ensure that our team was given the tools to succeed with our clients.

                For me, working with Saswat on any given project was nothing short of a collaborative effort. Soliciting feedback, providing realistic timelines, and offering alternative solutions are an integral part of his process to deliver the best possible outcome.

                Having worked with multiple teams in my 20 plus years in the software environment, I can without a doubt state that, any team having Saswat as a member is a stronger, more agile, more cohesive, and ultimately more productive team.

                <br />Saswat and I worked closely for three years and he is one of the most talented and hardworking leader in my group. He is a leader with strong technical background , can handle any complex and challenging task. His strength is his commitment towards the delivery and can turn any risky delivery into a timely delivery. I would highly recommend saswat as Technical Manager or Sr Delivery manager and he fits right to the definitions of these titles.
